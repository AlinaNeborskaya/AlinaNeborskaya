### Hi there 👋

Му name is Alina Neborskaya 😄, I'm from Minsk. I am a QA Engineer :muscle:, have an about 5 years of experience. 
- :computer: I was testing web applications, making SQL-queries (MySQL, PostgreSQL), made API requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH), writing tasks 
and bugs in such BTS as Jira, Trello, Redmine and even Gitlab. Writing checklists, test-cases and reports, I have even taken code 
changes using Git.
